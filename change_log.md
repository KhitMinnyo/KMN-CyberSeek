## [2.1.1] — 2026-08-10

### Added
- **True resume for vulnerability analysis** — per-port Nmap NSE scans and per-service CVE lookups (NVD, searchsploit, Vulners) write completion markers to `scan_results`. Resume skips already-done work.
- **NVD NIST API v2 integration** (`cve_lookup.py`) — free public CVE lookup, no API key required. Rate-limited at 0.7 s/request. Falls back silently on error.
- **searchsploit integration** — local ExploitDB query per discovered service+version. Zero network dependency.
- **Per-port Nmap NSE vuln scan** (`scanner.py`) — `--script "vuln and not intrusive" --script-timeout 20` per open port, with separate `VULN_PORT_TIMEOUT` env var.
- **stdin=DEVNULL on all subprocesses** — eliminates terminal hijacking by interactive tools (smbclient, enum4linux, etc.).
- **Credential injection** (`_inject_credentials`) — pre-execution rewrite embeds known credentials into tool flags for smbclient, enum4linux/ng, crackmapexec, rpcclient, evil-winrm, mysql, impacket tools.
- **AI context: discovered credentials** — actual `user:pass` pairs shown to AI with per-tool embedding examples.
- **Stage + status persistence** (`_save_session_status`) — `current_stage` and `status` written to DB at every transition. Sessions no longer revert to `reconnaissance` on restart.
- **Threat Intel — Structured DB section** — new top section on the Threat Intel page shows NVD, searchsploit, and Nmap NSE findings from the `vulnerabilities` table across all sessions. Filterable by source, risk level, and service.
- **Global `/api/vulnerabilities` endpoint** — queries `vulnerabilities` table across all sessions with optional filters.
- **AI decisions persistence** — all 6 `session.ai_decisions.append()` sites now also write to `ai_decisions` DB table immediately. Restored on session reload. Cleared on restart/rescan.
- **Action-required banners on Overview tab** — orange banner with inline approve/deny buttons when commands are pending; yellow warning when loop prevention was triggered.

### Fixed
- Vulnerability analysis timing out — `--script vuln` was running all NSE scripts. Changed to `"vuln and not intrusive"` with `--script-timeout 30`.
- Vulnerability scan blocking AI analysis — was `await`ed inline; changed to `asyncio.create_task()`.
- Stage regression on restart — post-nmap stage was incorrectly set to `"vulnerability_analysis"` (skipping enumeration). Fixed to `"enumeration"`.
- smbclient `Password:` prompt hanging sessions permanently — fixed by `stdin=DEVNULL` + `_inject_credentials`.
- `_CRED_PATTERNS` IndexError — john regex had only 1 capture group, expected 2.
- `ask_ai_local` missing `memory` parameter for Ollama context.
- `_compute_next_run` crash on month-end datetime arithmetic.
- `requires_approval` substring false positives — added word-boundary matching.
- `_EXPLOIT_SIGNALS` false positives — "password", "200 ok", "database" were matching normal recon output.
- Strategic state not persisted to DB — plan was lost on backend restart.
- API system prompt using wrong message role.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-xx

### Added
- Strategic layer (AI Planner) — separate Strategist AI pass updates multi-step plan and writes reflection after each command.
- Hybrid memory retrieval (FindingsIndex) — Ollama embeddings + TF-IDF lexical fallback for semantically relevant finding lookup.
- Context-aware memory for local Ollama — adapts system prompt and output budget to model's context window size.
- Episode compression — every 5 commands, recent history is compressed to a structured summary.
- Anti-loop guardrail — halts auto-execution if AI suggests a recently-executed command; logs `loop_prevention` decision.
- VERIFIER pass — independent AI critique of high-risk commands before execution in FULL_AUTO_MODE.
- Service test-state machine — `untested → in_progress → tested → exploited` tracked deterministically.
- Deterministic credential reuse — auto-queues reuse against all discovered services when credentials are extracted.
- Scheduled scans — recurring scan schedules with cron-style configuration.
- DOCX / PDF report generation.
- Threat Intel page — AI-directed open-web research cache (`threat_intel` table).
- Scope allowlist enforcement.
